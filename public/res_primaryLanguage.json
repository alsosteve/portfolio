      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steve Ngo, and for the last half a decade Iâ€™ve spent most of my time working in the digital media profession. My previous employment includes being a documentation production specialist for the United States Army. The job duties for that role include photographer and videographer. After leaving the service I decided to get an associate degree and work freelance in graphic design. I am now working in front end web development. I decided to become a software developer because of my background in digital media and falling in love with the technical side of it. Just like how large companies incorporate vertical integration to the growth I decided to do the same with my trade. Whether you need a lens specialist, branding specialist, or software engineer, I can do it all! I love creating products to help my customers grow their businesses and get their word out there. When I make a product for them I want it to feel like itâ€™s them saying, hello world, Iâ€™m here and Iâ€™m waiting for you to come see what I have to offer for you. And thatâ€™s how I want people to see me, hello! Iâ€™m here and Iâ€™m waiting for you to come see what I have to offer you!",
